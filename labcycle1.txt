<p align="justify"><b> Eid </b>
(sometimes known as Eid ul-Fitr), also called the "Festival of Breaking the Fast", is a religious holiday celebrated by Muslims
 worldwide that marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan.This religious Eid is the only day in the month of 
Shawwal during which Muslims are not permitted to fast. The date for the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on when the new moon 
is sighted by local religious authorities, so the day of celebration varies by locality. The holiday is widely called Korité in West Africa.
Eid al-Fitr has a particular salat (Islamic prayer) that consists of two rakats (units) generally performed in an open field or large hall. 
It may only be performed in congregation (jamāʿat) and features six additional Takbirs (raising of the hands to the ears while saying "Allāhu ʾAkbar", 
meaning "God is the greatest") in the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam: three at the start of the first rakat and three just before rukūʿ in the second rakat.Other Sunni schools usually have twelve Takbirs, similarly split in groups of seven and five.

<p>
A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division 
Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a 
mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals 
in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.
Pollination have two types which is self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther 
is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from 
the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.

<p>
In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.
Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans
 and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent
 on fruits as a source of food.Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges,
 and strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.

In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. 
In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants 
above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. 
Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way 
to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. 
Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.

<p>
Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
 applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.
 The alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods
 derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, 
nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, 
but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to 
consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.
